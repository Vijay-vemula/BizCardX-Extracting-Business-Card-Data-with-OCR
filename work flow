This code is a Streamlit application that allows users to upload business card images, extract information from them using OCR (Optical Character Recognition), and perform various operations on the extracted data.

Here's a breakdown of the code:

Importing the necessary libraries:

pandas for data manipulation and analysis.
streamlit for building the web application.
easyocr for performing OCR on the business card images.
mysql.connector for connecting to a MySQL database.
PIL (Python Imaging Library) for working with images.
cv2 (OpenCV) for image processing.
os for file and directory operations.
matplotlib.pyplot for visualizations.
re for regular expressions.
Establishing a connection to the MySQL database using the mysql.connector library.

Creating the Streamlit application:

Defining the page background image using CSS.
Setting the title of the application using st.title.
Creating a file uploader widget using st.file_uploader to upload the business card image.
Creating a sidebar menu using st.sidebar.selectbox with options to add, view, update, and delete business card information.
Implementing different actions based on the selected menu choice:

If the choice is "Add":

Displaying the uploaded image using st.image.
Extracting information from the image using OCR and EasyOCR.
Inserting the extracted information into the MySQL database using SQL queries.
If the choice is "View":

Retrieving and displaying the stored business card information from the MySQL database using SQL queries and pd.DataFrame.
If the choice is "Update":

Creating a dropdown menu to select a business card to update.
Displaying the current information for the selected business card.
Allowing users to modify the information and update it in the database.
If the choice is "Delete":

Creating a dropdown menu to select a business card to delete.
Displaying the current information for the selected business card.
Providing a button to confirm the deletion and removing the business card information from the database.
Displaying the Streamlit application using st.caption.

This code provides a basic framework for building a business card management application using Streamlit, OCR, and a MySQL database. You can further customize and enhance the functionality according to your specific requirements.
